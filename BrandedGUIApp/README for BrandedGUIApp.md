# How to Create a Branded PowerShell GUI Application #

**PowerShell Studio 2016**<br>
June Blender, August 30, 2016<br>


The files in the [BrandedGUIApps](https://github.com/juneb/ThinkingInEvents/tree/master/BrandedGUIApp) folder create the elements of the dark theme that I use to create the demo dark theme in: [A Branded Image for a PowerShell GUI App](http://info.sapien.com/index.php/guis/gui-design-best-practice/branded-powershell-gui). 

This theme was designed as an exercise to learn to create and use the elements of a branded theme, but feel free to use them and to contribute your designs to this repository.

Here's how to use them to apply the dark theme style that I create in the blog to your PowerShell GUI apps in PowerShell Studio.

<hr>

**Step 1: Find your templates directory**<br>
To make the dark theme templates effective, you must place them where PowerShell Studio can find them. That value is your Templates directory. The default is: $home\Documents\SAPIEN\Templates

1. Click **Home**, and in the Windows group, click **Options**.<br>
2. In General/Directories, see the value of **Template Directory**.  

**Step 2: Copy the Files**<br>
In these instructions, I refer to your templates directory as Templates.

- Copy the [SAPIEN Branded Form (Dark Theme) directory](https://github.com/juneb/ThinkingInEvents/tree/master/BrandedGUIApp/SAPIEN%20Branded%20Form%20(Dark%20Theme))** to ..\Templates\Forms.
- Copy the .properties files to '..\Templates\Property Sets'
- Copy the .control file to '..\Templates\Control Sets'

Have fun and contribute! -- juneb
