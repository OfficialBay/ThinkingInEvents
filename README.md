# Thinking In Events
This GitHub repo contains the PowerPoint slides and code that I use in my *Thinking in Events* hands-on lab. 

If you'd like me to present this hands-on lab (or a different one!) to your user group, contact me at [juneb@sapien.com](mailto:juneb@sapien.com) or on Twitter at [@juneb_get_help](http://twitter.com/juneb_get_help).

This repo contains:

* **ThinkingInEvents-UserGroupTalk.pptx**: Slides

* **Get-Service.psf**: PowerShell Studio source file for the app that we build in the lab.

* **Get-Service.Export.ps1**: The .ps1 file of code that actually runs when you run Get-Service.psf.  

* **Run-Script.psf**: PowerShell Studio source file for the "Run My Script" app.

* **New-DateFile.ps1** and **Today.txt**: Files that Run-Script.psf uses.

* **Get-Service-ScopedVariable.psf**: PowerShell Studio version of Get-Service that shows how to use variables whose values are shared by all event handlers in the script.

* **Get-Service-ScopedVariable.Export.ps1**: The app-independent version of the .psf file. 

For questions or comments, use the Issues feature in this repo.
