# Thinking In Events
Slides and code for user groups

This GitHub repo contains the PowerPoint slides and code that I use in my *Thinking in Events* hands-on lab. 

It contains:

* **ThinkingInEvents.pptx**: Slides

* **Get-Service.psf**: PowerShell Studio source file for the app that we build in the lab.
 
* **Run-Script.psf**: PowerShell Studio source file for the "Run My Script" app.

* **New-DateFile.ps1** and **Today.txt**: Files that Run-Script.psf uses.
