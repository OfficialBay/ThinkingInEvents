# GetTextFromChildForm  #
This is a demo project that shows you how to build a very simple two-window PowerShell GUI application in PowerShell Studio.

This project is designed to demonstrate how to create a multi-form PowerShell GUI app, including:

- How to open the child form from the parent form
- How the MainForm.psf code gets the Text property of the textbox in ChildForm.psf
